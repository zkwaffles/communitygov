## Reason for post
YFI governance is being underutilized. Community governance is a hugely powerful tool. It has the potential to harness the passion and hard work of hundreds if not thousands of people. Yearn needs to incentivize bottom-up innovation with explicit rewards for contributions that move the yearn ecosystem forward. 

Purpose of this post is to guage interest in a reward system for YFI governance contributions and community-inspired innovations. 

## Possible solutions
- Bounty system for passed yearn governance proposals
- Reward successful pull requests
- Hackathon with reward for best contribution

## Details to be ironed out:
Up for discussion, but this post specifically focuses on innvations that happen outside the core development team (bottom-up projects). It is unclear at this point exactly what a reward system would look like. Some questions immediately come to mind:
- How do we determine which contributions to reward? What types of contributions are the best for yearn's future?
- Where will reward funds come from?
- Are there existing platforms that could help yearn achieve the same goals? 


Interested to hear what y'all think about this. Try to break it, why might this not work?
